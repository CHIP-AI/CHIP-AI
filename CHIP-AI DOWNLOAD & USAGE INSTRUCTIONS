CHIP'S COMMANDS:
1. SEARCH

User (you): "open firefox" (or "Safari" or "Google Chrome")

CHIP: "Would you like me to conduct a search?"

User (you): "yes"

CHIP: "tell me what you want me to search."

User (you): "CHIP IS THE BEST AI ASSISTANT"

Now CHIP will open firefox and search for the words "CHIP IS THE BEST AI ASSISTANT" in the search box.

IMPORTANT NOTE:

If You say "no" after CHIP asks you if you would like her to conduct a search CHIP will just open the browser you want without any additional steps.

2. OPEN COMMANDS

User (you): "open (here you simply say any app on your MAC and CHIP will open them automatically.)(steam games with desktop icons supported)
EXAMPLE: Lets say you chose the messages app.

CHIP "opening messages"

then messages will simply open.

3. CLOSE COMMANDS

User (you): "close messages" (again any app you chose but in this case lets say you chose the messages app)

CHIP: "closing messages"

now messages will instantly and seamlessly close.

4. STANDBY MODE

This is the most important part of CHIP as it is the thing that makes CHIP so accessible at all times.

Lets say you've just searched up youtube through chip and you don't want chip to continue listening to commands but you want him to wait for you to need her again.

User (you): "standby mode"

CHIP: "Entering Standby Mode Now."

Standby mode will also be entered if CHIP detects that you have not spoken a command for 25 seconds OR CHIP could not understand what you said a total of 5 times. This quickly allows 
CHIP to restart and work seamlessly like before.

If you want CHIP to come back simply say "hey chip" clearly one time and she will come back.

5. SHUTTING DOWN CHIP

If you want CHIP to completely shut down and not wait for a "hey chip" simply say "shut down".

NOTE: After every command CHIP will kindly ask "Anything else?" here you can also say "no shut down" to simulate more generic conversations with CHIP.\
